            <li>50g instant coffee</li>
            <li>400g refined sugar</li>
            <li>240ml boiling water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla essence</li>
            <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of powdered milk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of chocolate powder 50% cocoa</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon grated nutmeg</li>
           </ul>

           <h2>Preparation Method</h2>

           <p>In the bowl of a mixer, start by mixing the instant coffee, which gives it an intense and comforting flavor, with the sugar, which will sweeten it just right. Then add the cocoa powder, which will give it a bitter and sophisticated touch, and the cinnamon, which brings an enveloping aroma and a light touch of spices. The powdered milk adds creaminess and smoothness to the cream, while the chocolate powder will enrich the flavor, making it irresistible. Don't forget a pinch of salt, which will balance all the flavors, and the nutmeg, which is a secret touch for an even more special flavor.</p>

           <p>Now, add the boiling water, which will help dissolve all the ingredients, and the vanilla essence, which will perfume the cream and give it a sweet and delicate touch. With everything mixed, beat on high speed for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the cream is very voluminous, light and airy, creating a light and creamy texture.</p>

           <p>Once ready, store the cream in jars with lids, always remembering to keep it in the refrigerator or freezer to maintain freshness and quality. To serve, simply mix 1 to 2 spoons of this cream in a cup of hot milk, coffee, hot chocolate or even plant-based milk, for an even more delicious flavor. Enjoy!</p>
